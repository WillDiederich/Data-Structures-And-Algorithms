# Trees

## Description

## Types
#### **Binary Tree:** 
- A Binary Tree is a type of Tree where every node has at most two children.
#### **Binary Search Tree:**
- A Binary Search Tree is a type of Binary Tree where the value of every node is greater than every node in its left subtree and less than every node in its right subtree.
#### **AVL Tree:** 
- An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree.
#### **Red-Black Tree:**
- A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree, where every node contains a red/black color indicator used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.

## Traversal

#### **Preorder Traversal (Depth-First)**
  1. Visit the current node.
  2. Traverse the left subtree.
  3. Traverse the right subtree.

#### **Inorder Traversal (Depth-First)**
  1. Traverse the left subtree.
  2. Visit the current node.
  3. Traverse the right subtree.

#### **Postorder Traversal (Depth-First)**
  1. Traverse the left subtree.
  2. Traverse the right subtree.
  3. Visit the current node.

#### **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First)**
  1. Find the tree height.
  2. Print the nodes for each level.
